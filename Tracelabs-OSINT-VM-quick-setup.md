### Set Keyboard:
The VM is neat, and very cool. Before starting working with it, I recommend doing updates.
User:password are osint:osint 

### Update the VM:

Run the script "Update System", visible on Desktop.

or


Open a terminal (Ä‰ alt t) then:
```
$sudo apt update
$sudo apt upgrade -y
```
If you are not familiar with linux, "apt" stands for Aptitude, it's a package manager for this Debian based distribution. You can use "snap" instead in the command for more recent debian based OS.

It might take a bit of time.
