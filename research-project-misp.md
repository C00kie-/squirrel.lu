# Social Perspectives in Intelligence Activities within Sharing Communities


### Introduction

### Subject scope
Intelligence activity, a prevalent practice across various fields, has continually evolved in response to the changing dynamics of human societies. The shift from analog to digital has significantly transformed social practices and modes of communication.
The transmission of information is a crucial component of intelligence activities and has attracted attention in anthropology and social sciences. This research is dedicated to understanding and describing the information exchange practices among threat intelligence communities, especially those using MISP. We aim to explore the functioning and limitations of these practices within their cultural context, focusing on how these communities operate and interact within these frameworks.


### The interest in studying information sharing practices
While much of the research in information security and intelligence has traditionally emphasized practical, standardized, and technical facets of information sharing, the exploration of its social and cultural aspects has not been as extensive. Our research seeks to contribute to this area by offering insights and exploring potential avenues for further inquiry and improvement. We aim to enrich the understanding of information sharing by shedding light on these less explored dimensions, thereby opening the door for more comprehensive future research and practice advancements.


### Problem statement
We face missed opportunities for successful information sharing within the research community. To understand and address this issue, we aim to describe the information sharing processes, examining functional challenges from social and cultural perspectives. This involves identifying both the incentives for and barriers to sharing.


### State of the Art
A significant portion of academic research has been dedicated to examining the structure of information, with a particular emphasis on the tools employed for this purpose. Much of this research is specialized, focusing on areas like competitive analysis construction or the structuring of data exchanges.
In our bibliography, we have specifically included papers related to the MISP platform. This focus will facilitate our engagement with and interviews of groups actively involved in information sharing, leveraging insights from those who use MISP in their operations.

### Research methodology
### Research design:


A series of interviews are conducted with various sharing communities. We aim to compare the actual usage of the platform, as observed by us, with the users' perspectives as shared in the interviews.

We utilize both technical observations, such as platform statistics, and qualitative insights from the interviews, through discourse analysis.

As a starting point, we included a list of question related to information sharing addressed to participants "Example list".

We narrow our questioning about the following points:

•	Common assumed (survey) reasons why organizations are not sharing.

•	Common reasons why organizations are sharing.

In order to integrate as much data as possible and to avoid pre-interview categorization, we perform free interviews.


### Data Analysis Model
•	Collection of structured information from sharing platforms.

•	Conducting interviews using an unstructured or semi-structured approach.

Expected Results and Contribution.

Our research aims to detail the social practices that facilitate information sharing. The focus is on uncovering and testing social models to better understand specific dynamics in this area. Key areas of exploration will include:

•	Differentiating between organizations that primarily produce information and those that disseminate it, acknowledging that producers and sharers may be distinct entities.

•	Describing the contextual factors surrounding the creation and dissemination of information.

•	Analyzing the dynamics of information sharing within communities.

•	Investigating factors that could enhance the effectiveness of sharing practices.

These insights are expected to contribute to the development of more sophisticated detection mechanisms within organizations.


### Conclusion
The outcomes of our research could be influenced by several factors:

•	The challenge of managing a highly diverse (heterogeneous) dataset.

•	The presence of tampered or false information within sharing communities.

•	Constraints related to the representativeness of the dataset, particularly concerning specific sharing communities.

•	Significant deviations from established standards in data collection or analysis.

•	Challenges in data collection due to high confidentiality levels within certain sharing communities.
