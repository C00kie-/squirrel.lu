## 2019, Hello hackers

I came to IoT by the activity of reverse engineering, curious to discover what is under the hood of IoT devices. Here are a few questions I started with:

* What do we take for IoT devices?

* How do I approach theses puzzles the hardware way?

* Can I find a complete introduction to IoT security somewhere?

I bet you have the answers to these questions. Also, as Christmas coming, the end of the year is also a time for looking a bit at the year passed. I chose to turn this article into a return of experience, of a first year in the security industry and among the community of hackers.

It‚Äôs a bit about the path that is mine. Not because I value it this much to want to share it, but because I believe that when you start something difficult, it‚Äôs nice to see someone else who as done the same as you, or who is actually building this experience.

I came to IoT by working with a friend on ARM exploitation, our roads crossed on conference and when I mentioned I was interested in getting the part before the firmware emulation processes ; how to get the firmware part, my friend was interested too. We started digging and had great fun.

A few months before‚Ä¶

### Discovering the 0 and 1‚Äôs world

I studied a bit at 42. From this experience, the coding part made me dive into dependencies and libraries you regularly use on a system - when you run your program, as many programming people experience it. Later, this led me to question what was inside my code, what kind of instructions was it for the machine, how compiled language works and why is it build a certain way ‚Äì yay compiler stories. 

Without transition.

Getting into the industry? 

Long story short, I wasn't thinking about infosec, I had an occasion to jump into real IT world with the "zig zag way as a career building methodology". We are many like this. One guys came at the school do a demo on Threat intel, and he had a couple of examples of user:password combos (example of, ofc it was a presentation of CTI).

I saw "Iron:maiden" in the first line. I thought "this is cool, are there really people doing this kind of job? I have to talk to that guy".

(For the junior reading this: how you get into infosec doesn't really matter so don't panic, we humans.)


### Hack?

I debug, I break and ... what's happening in memory? I did my first intentional buffer overflow and I understood the power of ‚Äúhijacking‚Äù a computer process to make it do something different. Here I was. Honestly I was as happy as the day I understood bit shifting (or was it the day I understood pointers?  well equally happy).  


### connecting the dots/

Generally, I seek to understand how a full system is built, how things related to each other, and/or based on which theories ‚Äì information, electronics, computing ‚Äì what design decisions are made. It requires a lot of study and a lot of question to ask, mostly to people who have a strong curiosity too. Great, I like people! So no problem to talk with others. And you know what? I always find it fascinating to see how people manage to learn something by themselves and how passionate they are. 
(For the junior: 
You want to learn: go to conferences, groups, makerspaces... and do stuff)

### What did I do? A few examples

I bought a Raspberry Pi to fix limits in my developing environment. I like the idea to have all I need in this little box.

I learn to take each problems at a time and make hierarchy between important topics and urgent topics, and that‚Äôs said, all of the IoT lab project is actually a side project, it‚Äôs not my daily job. So priorities matter.

I also adopted the strategy to chose topics of interests of what is ‚Äúbelow a C program‚Äù. And reading a lot of documentations about protocols implementations tells you a lot about the C lines you code anyway.

I push myself to teach what I‚Äôve learn, in conferences, to provide the best content I can and be open to answer people‚Äôs questions. I discover that as speaker we stress, and the joy after the presentation. It‚Äôs scary yay but honestly just try, it‚Äôs cool.

Aside from this,

I‚Äôm satisfied with a terminal and a notepad, notebooks and pens.

I do have printed books about hardware that I read like a child read a story before going to bed. Can you guess which ones? : clue: üê∞

### A few words on priorities and cooperation

(To junior... no wait, not only!)

Where do I start?

It‚Äôs a bit like, choosing your priorities was the most difficult things to do when I got into Computers and later into Security, because it implies making choices. But once you find something that works, which can be totally time consuming ‚Äì but in the good way - you are in. Test a lot of stuff. Follow what you like and discard what you don't, otherwise you will loose your time.

It‚Äôs a good feeling to feed your curiosity, it‚Äôs very satisfying on a personal level and it‚Äôs an amazing feeling to share with people who do the same, more then tech you become curious about them too. You let them guide you in their 0 and 1 universe the time of a conversation. Ok sometimes you don't understand everything but it's cool.

Hackers are passionate and patient people. As you can‚Äôt have all the knowledge in your brain it‚Äôs crucial to be able to share and have a group to count on, so develop your cooperation and communication skills. 
Relationships built around knowledge are fuelled by respect, I would suggest you to never forget where you come from, and who helped you. The world of IT and Security can be very competitive and it doesn‚Äôt lead people to behave all the same way. Rely on your group and allow them to rely on you. üòâ

This was a little return of experience. Thank you for your time reading this article.

I dedicate this article to my friends for Christmas, friends that inspires me, who got my back since years and with who we share doubts and joys for the same price. And to new friends, too.

Life with you guys is an awesome adventure.

Merry Christmas to all.
